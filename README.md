# Track Tracker - M1 Project

​
## Description

Tired of listening the same songs over and over again and want to find some new music but don't know how to search for it? With ***Track Tracker*** it's easier than you think! Now you can choose the music genre you want and get four random songs recommended to you. Not satisfied with the result? Don't worry, you can push the shuffle button as many times as you like and get four different songs every time. Or you can try with a different genre. Easy, isn't it? :smile:
​

***Track Tracker*** has been developed as a part of the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/es/desarrollo-web/barcelona?utm_source=google-sea&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BCN_app_campus_brand_GA_ES&utm_term={keywords}&gclid=Cj0KCQjwo6D4BRDgARIsAA6uN19LKsx0pvTH-iUz-RfrGakzau9RGdhJaixWuX32X92njICzz66RYbAaAncuEALw_wcB) Web Developement bootcamp with the [Deezer](https://developers.deezer.com/api) API and using JavaScript.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The **MVP** will include:
​
- **Homepage:** it will include all the links to navigate around the app and the music genre buttons which will lead the user to the random songs. :house:
- **Random songs selection page:** which will include the random selection of four songs (filtered by the genre the user has previously selected) and a shuffle button (to get a new selection of four songs). It will also give a link to get to the home page and change the genre. :twisted_rightwards_arrows:
- **Sign Up:** A registration form for new users with email and password validation. :wave:
- **Log In:** A form for signed up users with email and password validation. :key:
- **FAQ:** Everything you would want to know about ***Track Tracker***, just press play. :play_or_pause_button:
